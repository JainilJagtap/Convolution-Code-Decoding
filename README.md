# Convolutional Encoder and Decoder Project 🔄

This project focuses on the **design and implementation of a convolutional encoder and decoder** for various rates and constraint lengths, simulating a digital communication system with noise and error correction mechanisms.

## 📌 Highlights

- ✅ Developed a **Convolutional Encoder and Decoder** supporting different coding rates and constraint lengths.
- 📶 Implemented a **Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK)** modulation scheme to convert bits into transmittable signals.
- 🔊 Added **AWGN (Additive White Gaussian Noise)** to the transmitted signal to simulate real-world noisy channels.
- 📥 Designed a **Viterbi Decoder** with both:
  - **Hard Decision Decoding**
  - **Soft Decision Decoding**
  
  These implementations rely on **Dynamic Programming** and **Backtracking** to reconstruct the original message from the noisy received data.
